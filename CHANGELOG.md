## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **deb822 APT source file support (FR-01):** Dual-format parsing for modern `.sources` (deb822) and legacy `.list` files. Stanza-aware editing preserves field order, comments, and multi-line `Signed-By` values. Format-preserving writes. Renamed `distribution` → `suites` to match APT terminology. Edit dialog uses structured objects instead of format-specific strings. UX improvements: selection cleared after operations, search filter preserved, button feedback during add.
- **Docker management page (FR-20):** New sidebar page for managing Docker images, containers, and volumes. Three-tab interface with grouped tree views, batch remove/prune operations with confirmation dialogs, container start/stop, search filtering, lazy tab loading, and daemon status detection. Conditionally shown when Docker is installed.
- **Scheduled/automated cleaning (FR-16):** Settings page section with quick-setup toggle for weekly cleaning, custom schedule management (create/edit/delete via dialog), cleaning history viewer, threshold-based junk notifications, and post-clean tray notifications. Full schedule persistence via JSON with ScheduleManager and CleanerService backend.
- **Battery & disk health monitoring (FR-29):** Three-phase implementation — battery health CircleBar on Dashboard with capacity degradation alerts, SMART-based disk health monitoring via `smartctl`/IOKit with temperature and wear tracking, and Resources page integration with disk temperature history chart.
- **Startup Apps improvements (FR-10):** Search/filter bar, inline editor fields, and application icons in the startup app list.
- **ARM64 Linux CI (FR-06):** GitHub Actions workflow for ARM64 Linux builds and release artifacts.

### Fixed
- **BUG-06:** Large `/etc/hosts` files no longer freeze the UI at startup (deferred loading, batched model population, pre-compiled regex, incremental updates).
- **BUG-07:** HiDPI/4K scaling via `Dpi::scale()` utility, `@dpN` QSS tokens, and relaxed `.ui` size constraints.
- **BUG-08:** Wayland compatibility — guarded `primaryScreen()` null dereference, use `requestActivate()` for `xdg-activation` protocol.
- **BUG-10:** System Cleaner memory leak fixed — concurrent worker guards, proper destructor cleanup, scan result list clearing, eliminated redundant directory traversals.
- **BUG-39:** `getDesktopValue()` no longer truncates Exec lines containing `=` (env variables).
- **BUG-40:** FR-16 UI regressions — repositioned Scheduled Cleaning section above footer, replaced all hardcoded colors with QSS theme tokens, added dialog-title labels, primary/danger button styling, drop shadows, and focus ring fix.
- **BUG-41:** Manage Schedules dialog scroll area viewport now renders correctly in dark mode via transparent stylesheet pattern.
- Added generic `QDialog` and `QDialog QLabel` QSS rules for consistent dark mode dialog theming.
- Added `QCheckBox:focus` QSS rule to suppress platform-default purple focus ring.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-02-16

### Added
- **Hardware Info page (FR-12):** New sidebar tab between Dashboard and Startup Apps displaying System, Processor, Graphics, and Memory details. Platform-specific cache size retrieval (sysctl on macOS, sysfs on Linux).
- **Dashboard kiosk mode (FR-28):** F11 toggles fullscreen dashboard-only mode (hides sidebar and page title). ESC exits. State persisted across sessions. Temperature sensor and GPU device selections remembered.
- **Crowdin translations:** New translations via GitHub Action integration.

### Fixed
- **BUG-33:** Uninstaller "Purge" checkbox text now visible in dark mode (added `QCheckBox { color }` rule).
- **BUG-34:** Settings page author link changed from hardcoded blue to Nexis accent orange (`#E95420`).
- **BUG-35:** Removed non-functional "Donate" button from Settings page.
- **BUG-36:** System Cleaner "Total Size" label now visible in dark mode.
- **BUG-37:** System Cleaner `scanLoading.gif` animation now plays reliably; fixed QMovie memory leak on theme change.
- **BUG-38:** Hardware Info table rows now legible in dark mode; removed broken alternating row colours, added opaque item backgrounds.
- Hardware Info QGroupBox containers now size correctly (moved padding from QSS to layout margins).
- Hardware Info tables no longer show unnecessary scrollbars.

### Changed
- Dashboard system info panel removed (replaced by Hardware Info page).
- Dashboard temperature/GPU/network modules now fill full width in normal and kiosk modes.
- Hardware Info page simplified to 4 sections (System, Processor, Graphics, Memory); Storage, Network, and Thermal sections removed due to sizing limitations.
